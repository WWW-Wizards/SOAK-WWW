    "description": "An Alice Wonderland themed camp, we offer a Mad Hatter’s “high” tea party for a mad world! Travel down the rabbit hole and join us for “high” tea, with a wonderland of CBD-infused tea and sweets in a safe and socially inappropriate space to delve into nonsensical conversation and interactive games. Join the Cheshire Cat at the hookah, or get a tattoo or spanking from the Queen of Hearts. Find the bottles that say “Drink Me” to add a spark of special magic to your day.",
